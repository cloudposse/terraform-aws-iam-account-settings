  ## Security Info

  For better compliance with modern security best practices the following rules are enabled for the AWS account:

  Initial password creation (upon user creation) requires password to be reset on first login
  * Minimum password length: 16 chars
  * Requires at least one upper case letter
  * Requires at least one lower case letter
  * Requires at least one number
  * Requires at least one alphanumeric character
  * Passwords expire after 90 days
  * Passwords may not be repeated more than every 5th time you reset a password
  * Furthermore, MFA is required to assume a role (access to dev/staging/prod accounts), which is how access is granted to any and all AWS resources for staging/production.

  These password requirements are a best effort to meet PCI DSS v3.2.1 regulations for passwords and MFA, as published in May 2018 (in this instance, only for AWS)
